View the live version of this app here:
[https://peaceful-plains-44637.herokuapp.com/](https://peaceful-plains-44637.herokuapp.com/)

## Prerequisites
In order to run the PUNT prediction program, you need to have a set of credentials for the mysportsfeed.com API.

## To Run Locally
`yarn install`
`yarn start`
The application will now be live on localhost:3000

## How To Debug
Assuming dependencies are installed, run the following:
`yarn client`
...this will start the front end application.  Next, to start the backend, from within Visual Studio Code, open the server/server.js file and select debug->start debugging.  Again, the application will be on localhost:3000 but one can debug the application by placing breakpoints inside their VSCode window.
