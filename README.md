## How To Debug
Assuming dependencies are installed, run the following:
`yarn client`
...this will start the front end application.  Next, to start the backend, from within Visual Studio Code, open the server/server.js file and select debug->start debugging.  Again, the application will be on localhost:3000 but one can debug the application by placing breakpoints inside their VSCode window.
